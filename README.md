# Model_Cloning
Repository allows you to replace 9 potential nlp pos-taggers (Legacy Models) with neural network based models (Cloned models). You will find huge efficiency improvement as models can ustilize potential hardwares such as GPUs. Ease-of-use and other powerful properties of neural networks are plus.
